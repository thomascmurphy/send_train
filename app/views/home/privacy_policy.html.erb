</div>

<div class="row large_margin_bottom">
  <div class="col-xs-12">

    <p>
        The Climber.Training application and the associated Climber.Training website available at www.climber.training ("Climber.Training") are owned and operated by Climber.Training ("us" "we" or "our"). The Climber.Training application and website provide a platform where you can build a climbing training plan and track your climbing progress in order to determine the effectiveness of your workouts. This Climber.Training Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any information submitted to us or collected through your use of Climber.Training.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Information</h2>
    <p>
        The information addressed in this Privacy Policy includes "Personal Information," which is information about you that is personally identifiable such as your full name or e-mail address as well as "Non-Identifiable Information," which is non-public information that may be associated with or linked to a specific Climber.Training account but does not by itself permit the identification of individual persons (e.g., demographic, interests, or site usage information). This Privacy Policy does not pertain to any information that is publicly available on or through Climber.Training.
    </p>

    <h2>Consent by Accessing Climber.Training</h2>
    <p>
        By accessing or otherwise using Climber.Training, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and the associated Terms of Service (set forth on <a href="<%= url_for controller: '/home', action: 'terms_of_service' %>"><%= url_for controller: '/home', action: 'terms_of_service', :only_path => false %></a>). You expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information and Non-Identifiable Information according to this Privacy Policy.  Your Personal Information may be processed by us in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Policies Regarding Children</h2>
    <p>
        When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>Information You Submit to Climber.Training</h2>
    <p>
        In general, we collect both Personal Information and Non-Identifiable Information that you submit to us voluntarily through Climber.Training. We collect information that you submit in the process of creating or editing your account and user profile on Climber.Training. For example, our registration and login process requires you to provide us with a valid email address and a password of your choice. When you personalize your profile and use the features of Climber.Training, we will collect any information you voluntarily provide, and we may also request optional information to support your use of Climber.Training, including such Non-Identifiable Information as your year of birth, gender and other demographic information. We also collect information in the form of the content that you submit during your use of Climber.Training, such as workouts, climbs, and other information you choose to submit, including information from other social networks that you choose to link to your Climber.Training profile.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you send an e-mail to us, or fill out our "Comment" form through Climber.Training, we will collect your e-mail address and the full content of your e-mail, including attached files, and other information you provide. Additionally, we collect any information that you voluntarily enter, including Personal Information, into any postings, comments, or forums within the Climber.Training community.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Use of Technology and Your Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        As you use Climber.Training, certain information may be collected from you through our use of technology, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. In connection with your use of the Climber.Training Application through a mobile device, we may also gather information from your mobile device including its unique identification number and your geographic location. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the products, solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on Climber.Training you clicked. This type of information is collected to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and Site interaction so that we can offer better Site experiences and tools in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address may vary from session to session. We, or our service providers, may track your IP Address when you access Climber.Training to assist with ad targeting.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Cookies" are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables a site or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture certain information. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a Cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all Cookies. You do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer, Safari or Google Chrome) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your Cookies. If you turn Cookies off, you may not have access to many features that make your Climber.Training experience more efficient and some of our services may not function properly.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may also enable third-party advertising networks, advertisers and ad servers to promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements on Climber.Training. These advertisers and ad servers may use their own Cookies and/or "Web Beacons" (which are usually small, transparent graphic images) in order to monitor information related to those advertisements and your use of Climber.Training. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of a third-party and the advertiser. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad servers. For more information about third-party advertising, and to exercise your choices regarding advertising customization by third-party ad networks, visit the Network Advertising Initiative website.
